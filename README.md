# Assessment-of-BPSK-and-QPSK-over-AWGN-Channel

My Project of the Digital and Wireless Communications Course Offered in Fall 2021 @ Zewail City.

In this project, I implemented the implement the BPSK and QPSK, then assessed their passband transmission over an AWGN Channel.

## Implementation Steps:

            1) Generate random binary information stream.
            2) Perform BPSK and QPSK on the binary generated stream.
            3) AWGN that follows Gaussian(0, N0/2) is added to the information stream.
            4) Decode the received signal at the receiver side using ML Rule.
